# Modified PSAP 
This is a modified version of the *Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP)*.

## Description
The PSAP (Cherek, 1981) is a task that has been used frequently to study human aggression. Participants are told that they may press a button a number of times to subtract money from their opponent(s) or press a different button to earn money. Several slight variations of this task exist (e.g., adding a condition in which they can protect their own points from future subtractions). The version that I have posted here is a modified as well as expanded version of the original task. The participant competes against *12 different opponents* (1 opponent per trial) and is given the option to **earn** a point, **deduct** a point from their opponent (whichever opponent is playing in the given trial), or **protect** their points from a future deduction. Further, in half of the trials, participants are told that they may earn additional money if they win (i.e., press the button faster that their opponent).

## Task Design
The modified PSAP is a completely within-subjects task. There are 50 trials wherein half of the time participants believe they are playing for money and the rest of the time they simply play for points to win the game. In each trial, participants play agianst one (out of a possible twelve) opponent to press a button faster than the other person to achieve a specific outcome (i.e., to subtract a point from their opponent, to earn a point for themselves, or to protect their points from deductions). The table below list the main parameters and conditions within the task.

Parameter    |          Description            |  Values
-------------|---------------------------------|--------------
Condition    |  Playing for points vs. money   |  $$, 0
Opponent     |  Participant's current opponent |  1 of 12 randomly generated letters
Outcome      |  Who won/lost the round         |  'You won!', 'You lost!'
OppResp      |  The opponent's decision        |  'Opponent [X] [subtracted, protected, earned] a point!'
