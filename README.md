# PSAP_Modified_new
A modified version of the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP).

## Description
The PSAP (Cherek, 1981) is a task that has been used frequently to study human aggression. Participants are told that they may press a button a number of times to subtract money from their opponent(s) or press a different button to earn money. Several slight variations of this task exist (e.g., adding a condition in which they can protect their own points from future subtractions). The version that I have posted here is a modified as well as expanded version of the original task. The participant competes against *12 different opponents* (1 opponent per trial) and is given the option to **earn** a point, **deduct** a point from their opponent (whichever opponent is playing in the given trial), or **protect** their points from a future deduction. Further, in half of the trials, participants are told that they may earn additional money if they win (i.e., press the button faster that their opponent).

## Task Design
The modified PSAP is a completely within-subjects task. There are 50 trials wherein half of the time participants play for money and the rest of the time they play just to win.
